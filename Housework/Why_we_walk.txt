//Summary of Why We Walk by Adam Gopnik//
//http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/heavens-gaits//

* things we do for a purpose, often become things we do for pleasure, „particulary when we have no longer to do them.“
* they get attached to „a philosophy or to the pursuit of some profit“

==== Types of Walking ====
* **European** culture: walking as **indivual** activity to **clear your head** and let your mind wander (Western form of meditation)
* other form: walking to **escape** daily life and social roles
* protest (walk around the same block again and again)
* actively perceiving a place in a **randomized** way (New York way of city-walking)


==== Why I Walk ====
* meditative thinking/ reflection
* unexpected randomized influences on thoughts
* explore a place in a randomized way/ change of perspective
