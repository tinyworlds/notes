====== Designing for Games ======
Created Mittwoch 04 Mai 2016

Björn suggests: watch the Dragon speech! ("one of most inspiring talks about Game Design")

* in **smaller** studios you have mostly **generalist** artists, in **big** companies very **specialized** people
* Björn suggests: going broad in study first is best; I agree, have a lot more freedom (in job and art) and better able to adapt to change; specialize on your qualities
* Björn says: traditional 2D animation is really good to learn how to do good animations in general
* interesting job opportunity for 3d artists: go in product development ([[../../Game_Studies/3D_Printing.txt|3d printing]])

==== 3D Environment Artist ====
* do understand what "space" means/ have good spatial understanding
* collection of spaces in mind (how they feel like) - a mind library of how places feel and look
* do **field research** to understand how a place **feels** (smells, sounds, looks ...)
-> create a toolset to collect memories and experiences of places & how they work
	-> maybe sketchbook & netbook for field research
	-> experience and reading to understand how things work
	-> a wiki would work pretty well to bring it all together
see: [[../The_Creative_Process.txt|The Creative Process]]

* understanding of how light physically works can increase quality of how you light your worlds; next to good understanding of color
