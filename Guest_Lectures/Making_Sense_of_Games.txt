====== Making Sense of Games ======
Created Dienstag 03 Mai 2016

Speaker: Espen Aarseth (aarseth@itu.dk)

* idea: there are games and story-games/ ludo-narrative hybrids
* games are not narratives, but rather create experiences/memories the player may use to tell their own stories


* "Tellability Equation" model: Youtube views/Global copies sold(in Mio)=Tellability factor
-> how much people want to tell their own story (about the game)
-> probably unprecise model -  overly simplified - but may still turn out useful
