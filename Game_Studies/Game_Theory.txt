====== Game Theory ======
Created Donnerstag 14 April 2016

aka Game Studies - a discipline that deals with the critical analysis of games.

At the moment there are 3 major perspectives in Game Studies:
* Game Designers
* Social Sciences
* Human Sciences

===== Game Design =====
-> analysis and explanation of unconscious work
-> Theory of the 1st order - by the practitioners
-> development of terminology & "best practices"
-> How to make a good game?

Problem: artistical creation in the Modern Age is complex and ever-changing;
rules/best practices can only exist for a certain time/subgroup

===== Social Sciences =====
-> e.g. psychology, communication studies
-> Theory of the 2nd order - by "other" theoreticans
-> examine the influence of games on players
-> What are the effects of games?

Problem: error-prone, empiric research with little groups;
focus only on players, not game itself

===== Human Sciences =====
-> Theory of the 3rd order - by "expert" theoreticans
-> examine aesthetic & cultural meaning of games
->Gamification of Teaching & Research
-> Linkage of Theory & Practice



//The knowledge gained from Game Studies can be used for example to help with the creation process of games.//
//By abstrahizing we allow for artistic creation that goes beyond the replication of the known and successful and create something truly unique.//
