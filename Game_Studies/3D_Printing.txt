====== 3D Printing ======
Created Mittwoch 27 April 2016

* 1st step of digitalisation was about turning things into data
* 2nd phase - creating individual copies of a general concept - 3D printing turns data back into things

===== Technology Examples =====
* hearing aids are nowadays mostly 3D printed, based on a scan of your ear
* 3D printed electro car, house, bridge, room

* architectural models
* there is a 3D printer on the ISS!

* there are 3D food printers

* 3D printed body parts
* 3D printed weapons


===== Historical Perspective =====
Digital fabrication marks the beginning of a new phase in the history of economy and culture
* in the [[../Modern_Media_History/Digital_Age.txt|digital age]] people work dezentralised, from home with automated software
* ways of communication and transportation over long distances merge (transfer goods via the Internet)

===== Research and Fantasy =====
* an universal digital fabricator, much like when the first PCs where created as universal home-machines
* print solar-cells on pretty much everything
* 4D printing: things assembles themself and/or modify themselves on command or in a selfregulatory way
* 3D printing allows for more complex objects for the same amount of work ("Complexity for Free")
