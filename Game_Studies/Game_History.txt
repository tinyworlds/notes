unvollständig/möglichweise fehlerhaft

===== Procedural Turn =====
since the 1950s
-> digital games afford a new representational mode
- the construction of dynamic models of real world processes

-> videogames core representational mode is procedurality
-> procedural representation requires inscription in a medium that merely describes them
-> this ability to execute a series of rules is unique for computers

===== Hyperepic Turn =====
since the 1970s
-> afford games interactive with multi-linear storylines & open story worlds that can be roamed more or less freely

===== Hyperrealistic Turn =====
since the 1990s
-> digital games afford the real-time and interactive production of photorealistic images without indexicality
