Created Dienstag 26 April 2016

improve game experience by modelizing the player
(very messy notes)

===== Player Motivation =====
{{../deci_diagramm.jpg}}
//a possible way to differentiate short, medium and long term player behavior//

{{../chart.png}}
//different play styles or personality models - //**TODO:**// select personality models and create little entries on them//
