====== Pitch ======
Created Mittwoch 27 April 2016

Guardiola says:
* get immediately to the gameplay, how the player experiences the game (this is what we want)
* then people know what you're talking about later (this is how we did it)
* you can show similar games as references

* keep it short and to the point
* "is this thing I'm saying supporting the message I want to send to the audience?"
* make it visual and easily readable
* make it *sexy*

Bj√∂rn says:
* does it touch you? does it inspire you?
* for pitch videos: get a good voice-over, don't use your own voices
* visual design helps you to communicate ideas
